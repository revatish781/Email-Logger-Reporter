Email Logger & Reporter

 Description
This project simulates an email logging system and analyzes success and failure trends. It generates CSV reports and visualizes email statuses, helping track performance and identify top failed senders. Ideal for practicing Python automation, data aggregation, and visualization.

Features
- Generate synthetic email logs (`synthetic_email_logs.csv`)  
- Count successful vs failed emails  
- Identify top failed senders  
- Export analyzed data to CSV  
- Visualize email status counts using bar charts  

 Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming and automation  
- Data analysis using `pandas`  
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`  
- Working with synthetic datasets  

 How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed (recommended Python 3.8+).  
2. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
